# Combo Online: Interactive Combo Tutorial

_STATUS: not released yet_

This is IDE in browser, where you can develop some components with
[Combo](https://github.com/ilshad/combo) without installing anything locally.
It is written in Combo itself, see [sources](https://github.com/ilshad/combo-online/blob/gh-pages/src/combo_online/online.cljs).

## Goals

Its goal is to provide a way to start quickly and play with main
concepts of Combo library. In particular, students define UI by
clicking constructor and they play with idioms of functional
programming by describing all the logic with pure functions which
transform simple data structures.

## Getting started

[Click here](http://ilshad.com/combo-online) and enjoy!

## Online version limitations

- there is no way to define nested units
- there is no place to write custom render functions

The IDE is static SPA (single page app) without any backend service,
served by Github Pages.
